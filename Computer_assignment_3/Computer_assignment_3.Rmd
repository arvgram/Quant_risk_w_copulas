\\section(Random number generation from bivariate EVD) \\subsection(Parametric bivariate EV models) In the package \texttt{evd} the nine models and their respective dependence and asymmetry parameters are:


\begin{itemize}
    \item Logistic. Dependence parameter $\texttt{r}$ between (0,1]. Smaller \texttt{r} implies higher dependence.
    \item Asymmetrix logistic. Dependence parameter r, as in (symmetric) Logistic. Asymmetry parameters are $\texttt{t}_1$ and $\texttt{t}_2$. Indepence if any of $\texttt{t}_1, \texttt{t}_2$ are 0 or $\texttt{r = 1}$. For complete dependence $\texttt{t}_1= \texttt{t}_2$=1 and $\texttt{r} \rightarrow 0$.
    \item Husler-Reiss. Dependence parameter \texttt{r} $\in (0, \infty)$. Full dependence as $\texttt{r}$ $\rightarrow \infty$, and independence as $\texttt{r} \rightarrow 0$
    \item Negative logistic. Dependence parameter $\texttt{r}$ $>0$. Higher $\texttt{r}$ implies higher dependence. 
    \item Asymmetric negative logistic. Dependence parameter $\texttt{r}>0$ and asymmetry parameters $\texttt{t}_1,\texttt{t}_2$ $\in (0, 1]$. Indepence if any of $\texttt{t}_1,\texttt{t}_2, \texttt{r}$  approaches 0. Complete dependence if $\texttt{t}_1,\texttt{t}_2 = 1,1$ and $\texttt{r} \rightarrow \infty$.
    \item Bilogistic. Parameters $\alpha, \beta$. When $\alpha = \beta$ the model is equivalent to logistic with dependence parameter $\texttt{r} =\alpha$. As in logistic, when $\alpha = \beta =  \texttt{r} \rightarrow 0$ the model tends to complete dependence. Independence as either both tends to 1, or one is fix and other tends to 1.
    \item Negative bilogistic Parameters $\alpha, \beta$. When $\alpha = \beta$ the model is equivalent to negative bilogistic with dependence parameter $\texttt{r} =1\alpha$. When $\alpha = \beta \rightarrow 0$ the model tends to complete dependence. Independence as either both tends to $\infty$, or one is fix and other tends to $\infty$.
    \item Coles-Tawn. Parameters $\alpha, \beta > (0,0)$. As $\alpha = \beta \rightarrow \infty$ the model shows complete dependence. Independence as either both tends to 0, or one is fix and other tends to 0.
    \item Asymmetric mixed distribution. Parameters $\alpha, \beta$ fulfill the following conditions: $\alpha$ and $\alpha + 3 \beta > 0$, and $\alpha + 2\beta$, $\alpha + \beta \leq 1$ As $\beta$ is fix, the strength of dependence increases with $\alpha$. Complete dependence is not achievable. Independence as $\alpha = \beta = 0$.
